Original Site: https://huly.io/

Deployed Site: https://kraftbase-huly-io-clone.vercel.app/

### Hero Section

Completed the Navbar and styled it properly using flex and in the navigation for community and resources used shadcn navigation menu component.Mobile responsive hamburger is also shown properly

Due to lack of asset, i fetched the video of the background animation from their site and used it as a background by giving it a respective z-index and arranged the image inside the block accordingly. It may not be perfect on medium screen but on large and small screen it is perfect. 

Added infinite scrolling of Hero footer to mobile screen only 

### Bento Grid 

Added the respective font Martel Sans to the heading and then designed the bento grid using grid and col span where small screen had a span of 1 medium screen had a span of 2 and large screen had a span of 3. gave one card a col span of 1 and another card a col span of 2 to maintain 1:2 ratio and below in a similar manner maintained a 2:1 ratio. Again due to lack of assets used a similar video in all 4 cards.

### Work together like in the office

Again maintained a similar approach due to not having assets used the same video and gave it a border to make it look similar i was tying to add the background animation but was unable to do so, so i skipped it,
maintained a flex for all the 3 icons below it.

### sync with github

added a proper background border gradient to the image and then performed similar flex as the above 3 icons in the work together section 

### huly metabrain

here i maintained a grid col span of 5 in larger screen and 2 in medium and 1 in smaller. 

wasnt able to merge the two divs like the website due to not being expertise in framer motion but i tried to maintained the pattern as similar as possible.

### knowledge at your fingertips 

give it a typewriter effect in the heading wasnt able to add the tooltip and image as similar. 
made similar change in the animation as i can do . skipped the card which was fixed on the screen on the left side as i dont know how to do that

### footer

again due to lack of assets i fetched this video from the site only and didnt find any backgrond gradient as similar to the site maintained similarity between them using flex. Footer was also made properly and mobile responsive
